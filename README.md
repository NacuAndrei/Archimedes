# Archimedes - a game with interface (pygame)

Read the rules here: http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/archimedes.htm

Python game which uses pygame to draw the proper board.
It should have run with MinMax and AlphaBeta algorithms, but they have not been implemented yet.
Instead, the moves have a random cost.
